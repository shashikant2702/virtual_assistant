# Moonlight - Virtual Assistant

Moonlight is a voice-activated virtual assistant built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It can respond to various voice commands, such as opening websites, retrieving information from Google or Wikipedia, providing the current time or date, and more. This project leverages the Web Speech API for both speech synthesis (text-to-speech) and speech recognition.

## Features

- **Voice Commands**: Moonlight responds to various commands like greeting, opening websites, searching the web, and more.
- **Speech Synthesis**: Moonlight speaks back to the user based on the recognized commands using the `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` API.
- **Time and Date Queries**: Ask NEXUS for the current time or date.
- **Web Searching**: Perform web searches and open specific websites (Google, YouTube, Facebook, Wikipedia).
- **Customizable**: The assistant can be easily expanded with additional commands to meet specific requirements.
